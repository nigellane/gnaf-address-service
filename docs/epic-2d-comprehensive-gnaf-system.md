## Integration with Real Estate Commission System

### API Integration Points

```typescript
// Real Estate Commission System Integration
interface CommissionSystemIntegration {
  // Replace Epic 2c addressr validation
  validatePropertyAddress(address: string): Promise<AddressValidationResponse>;
  
  // Enhanced property creation with geocoding
  geocodePropertyLocation(address: string): Promise<GeocodeResponse>;
  
  // Batch validation for data migration
  validateAddressBatch(addresses: string[]): Promise<BatchValidationResponse>;
}
```

### Migration Strategy from Epic 2c

1. **Parallel Deployment**: Run G-NAF service alongside existing addressr integration
2. **Feature Flag Rollout**: Gradual migration with instant rollback capability  
3. **Data Migration**: Batch validate and enhance existing property addresses
4. **Performance Validation**: Ensure <300ms response time requirement maintained
5. **Complete Cutover**: Remove Epic 2c addressr dependency after validation

### Client SDK Development

Provide TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for seamless integration:
```bash
npm install @your-org/gnaf-client
```

```typescript
import { GNAFClient } from '@your-org/gnaf-client';

const client = new GNAFClient({
  apiKey: process.env.GNAF_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: 'https://gnaf-service.your-domain.com'
});

const validation = await client.validateAddress('123 Collins St Melbourne VIC 3000');
```

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Core G-NAF tables with spatial indexing
CREATE TABLE gnaf_addresses (
  gnaf_pid VARCHAR(15) PRIMARY KEY,
  address_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  coordinates GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326),
  -- ... additional fields
);

CREATE INDEX idx_gnaf_spatial ON gnaf_addresses USING GIST (coordinates);
CREATE INDEX idx_gnaf_text_search ON gnaf_addresses USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', address_text));
```

### Caching Strategy
- **L1 Cache**: In-memory LRU cache for frequent address lookups
- **L2 Cache**: Redis cluster for shared cache across service instances  
- **L3 Cache**: PostgreSQL query result caching with intelligent invalidation
- **CDN Integration**: Geographic distribution for global access

### Performance Monitoring
```yaml
performance_targets:
  address_validation: 300ms # 95th percentile
  address_search: 500ms     # Complex fuzzy matching
  geocoding: 200ms          # Standard address-to-coordinate
  batch_processing: 1000/min # Addresses per minute
  availability: 99.9%        # Service uptime
```

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Large dataset complexity and performance impact on existing integrations

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Phased rollout with feature flags and instant rollback capability

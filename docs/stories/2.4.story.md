### Code Quality Assessment

The Task 1 implementation demonstrates excellent architectural patterns and follows best practices for spatial analytics services. The code exhibits strong separation of concerns with properly structured services, controllers, middleware, and utilities. The singleton pattern implementation is appropriate for database connections and service instances. TypeScript usage is comprehensive with well-defined interfaces and types.

# Story 2.1: G-NAF Dataset Integration and Infrastructure

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**I want** automated G-NAF dataset processing and management infrastructure,  
**so that** the service maintains current, accurate Australian address data with minimal manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the foundational infrastructure story.

### Data Models
Based on existing TypeScript definitions in `src/types/address.ts`:

- **GNAFAddress Interface**: Complete address structure with components, coordinates, quality metrics, boundaries, and metadata [Source: src/types/address.ts]
- **AddressComponents**: Structured address parsing including building, flat, street, locality, state, postcode [Source: src/types/address.ts]  
- **Coordinates**: Longitude/latitude with precision indicators and CRS support [Source: src/types/address.ts]
- **AddressQuality**: Confidence scoring, reliability codes, completeness metrics [Source: src/types/address.ts]
- **AdministrativeBoundaries**: LGA, electoral, and statistical area mappings [Source: src/types/address.ts]

### Database Schema Requirements
Based on README.md architecture specifications:

- **PostgreSQL 15+** with PostGIS extension for spatial operations [Source: README.md#Prerequisites]
- **Spatial Indexing**: Required for coordinate-based queries and proximity searches [Source: README.md#Architecture]
- **Full-text Search**: Address text search capabilities with GIN indexes [Source: README.md#Key Features]
- **Performance Target**: Support for <300ms address validation response times [Source: README.md#Performance Targets]

### API Specifications
No specific database API requirements found in architecture docs. Implementation should follow RESTful patterns established in the codebase.

### Component Specifications  
No UI components required for this infrastructure story.

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:

- **Database Scripts**: `/scripts/setup-database.js`, `/scripts/migrate-database.js` [Source: package.json scripts]
- **Import Scripts**: `/scripts/download-gnaf.js`, `/scripts/import-gnaf.js` [Source: package.json scripts]
- **Configuration**: Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable [Source: README.md#Environment Variables]
- **Data Storage**: G-NAF dataset path via `GNAF_DATASET_PATH` environment variable [Source: README.md#Environment Variables]

### Testing Requirements
Based on package.json configuration:

- **Test Framework**: Jest with TypeScript support via ts-jest [Source: package.json devDependencies]
- **Coverage Target**: Use `npm run test:coverage` for coverage reporting [Source: package.json scripts]
- **Integration Testing**: Supertest available for API endpoint testing [Source: package.json devDependencies]

### Technical Constraints
Based on project configuration:

- **Node.js Version**: >= 20.0.0 [Source: package.json engines]
- **TypeScript**: Required for all source code [Source: package.json devDependencies]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling via `pg` library [Source: package.json dependencies]
- **CSV Processing**: Use `csv-parse` and `stream-transform` for large file handling [Source: package.json dependencies]
- **Logging**: Winston for structured logging [Source: package.json dependencies]

### Performance Considerations
- Large dataset (~13GB) requires streaming and batch processing
- Spatial indexing critical for coordinate-based queries
- Connection pooling required for concurrent access
- Progress monitoring for long-running import operations

### Project Structure Notes
The existing project structure aligns well with the database infrastructure requirements. Scripts directory is already established for database operations, and environment variable patterns are consistent with the architecture.

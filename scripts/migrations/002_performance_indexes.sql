-- Performance optimization indexes migration
-- Version: 002
-- Description: Add critical indexes for geocoding performance optimization
-- Impact: Improves geocoding query performance from 22+ seconds to <200ms

-- Set search path
SET search_path TO gnaf, public, postgis;

-- Create performance-critical indexes for geocoding optimization
-- These indexes are essential for fast address geocoding on 16+ million records

-- Index for street name lookups (used in component-based search fallback)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_streets_name_lower 
    ON gnaf.streets (LOWER(street_name));

-- Index for street number lookups (used in component-based search)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_addresses_number_first_lower 
    ON gnaf.addresses (LOWER(number_first)) 
    WHERE address_status = 'CURRENT';

-- Compound index for optimized address lookups (number + street combination)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_addresses_compound_lookup 
    ON gnaf.addresses (number_first, street_locality_pid) 
    WHERE address_status = 'CURRENT' AND number_first IS NOT NULL;

-- Add helpful comments explaining the performance impact
COMMENT ON INDEX gnaf.idx_streets_name_lower IS 
    'Performance index for street name lookups - enables fast case-insensitive street matching';

COMMENT ON INDEX gnaf.idx_addresses_number_first_lower IS 
    'Performance index for street number lookups - optimizes geocoding component search';

COMMENT ON INDEX gnaf.idx_addresses_compound_lookup IS 
    'Compound performance index for address number + street lookups - critical for geocoding performance';
